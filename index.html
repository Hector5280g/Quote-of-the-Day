        <p> Gary Vee is an entrepreneur, he thrives on being proactive and not making excuses for your problems. Gary worked at his family's liquor store from the ages of 19 to 30. He would put in 60-80 hour work weeks.Gary found different ways of making passive income. While working he saved and invested his money. Big opportunities came while building his capital such as being able to invest in facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, and Coinbase. The companies are all high tech companies that helped his portfolio explode. He wasn’t always lucky on his investments. Uber offered him early investment 3 times, but he denied it everytime, because he didn’t believe in it. But it turns out that Uber now is one of the biggest companies till this day. Gary Vee now helps preach the message of “ Don’t let anyone tell you what you can and cannot do, but nothing comes easy, you have to be ready to put the work in when it matters.” </p>
